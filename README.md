Title: Ward Management System

This app is designed with one thing in mind - effortless management of a patient's registration, admission and discharge to and from a hospital.

There are three main users of this application.

User 1 - Admin
User 2 - Ward Management Team
User 3 - Medical Team

Each user has a specific role and cannot access information that is not relevant to their role.

First and foremost, only the admin can create a new user and assign them to a role. Users are not allowed to register themselves.
The main role of the Ward Management Team is to register the patients and assign them to a ward and bed and later discharge them.
The main role of the Medical Team is to update the patient's medical information.
